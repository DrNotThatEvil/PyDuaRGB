    * Master slave system is alsmost done (altho stability improvements are nessesary)
        * Implemented Header containing message length.
        * Implemented checksum check at the end of messages.
        * Implemented method for handeling master data in RGBController.
        * Implemented way for RGBController to send leds to slaves without locking.
    * Improvements to JSONRPC server
        * Implemented animation argument checking
        * Implemented a few new API methods
    * Removed: Removed jsonrpc capabilty from slave configurations.
    * General codebase maintenence and improvements.
    * Improvements to docs:
        * Spelling fixes/improvements
        * Sentence structure improvments
        * Added documentation for new options.

    General public notes:
        I'm stil implementing some of the features promised in the documentation
        (Slave Mirror mode for example), but for the most part all features I want
        for the 0.1.0 release are implemented. My main focus before that point
        is on stability improvements, code cleanup and most of all Documentation.

        Secondly the test suite needs to be updated before 0.1.0.
        But i'm comfident we can move to 0.1.0 during this summer break.

    * Working on Master slave implementation.
    * Introduced shared network parent class for master and slave threads
      I can now work on the slave/master implementations more quickly.
    * Improvement: Added argparse for specifiing custom config location.

    * Codebase conforms to PEP8 (except tests)

04/06/18
    * Improvement: Started work porting spi to new spi_dev python module (this enables changing of the clockspeed)
    * Improvement: Started work on chip caching to significantly improve writing performance and stability.
    * Redesign: No more apitoken required for working with JSONRPC:
      Since the system only runs with HTTP anyway and should not be exposed to a remote network I droped the apitoken requirement.
    * Animations:  Added a few new animations for fun.
    * Codebase:    General code cleanup in some places. Still needs work.
    * Codebase:    Started on code cleanup so i can get a stable develop branch and start using feature branches.
