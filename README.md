# What is PyDuaRGB

PyDuaRGB is a python daemon to manage ledstrips on Raspberry Pi.
it's currently in development but will support the following features.

* Many animations.
* Can be controlled using a JSONRPC api (an easy standard to implement in your applications)
* Control multiple ledstrips using multiple raspberry pi's and animate them in sync.
* Push notifications from your android phone to pyduargb using an app (app still in development)
* Support for multiple ledstrip types.

## Documentation.

The documentation will explain how the system operates so you can implement it
in your applications. Please make sure to read the documentation once it's completed
I will create gifs explaining the work of the AnimationQueue since it's quite different from
the workings of a normal Queue system.

### Why the name pyduargb?
Well py because it's written in python. DuaRGB because it's named after 'F.J. Duarte' a laser phyicist,
I named it after him because Lasers and ledstrips both do stuff with light...
