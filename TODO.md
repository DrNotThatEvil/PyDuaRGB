before i can call this software stable and release ready.

A global list of features i want to implement:
* Master -> slave animations. (IE animations on one PI should continue on slave pi's)
* Improvments in speed.
* Improve how some animations work.
* Improve caching system
* Improve codebase to conform to PEP8
* More animations.

I also want to improve the codebase to work with python 2 currently
only version 3 is working/tested.

Secondly I want to write a android app that can push it's notifications to
a pyduargb ledstrip to notify you of specified events.
